# Script-After-Reset-Computer

This script allows me to install almost all the software that is useful to me after a reset of my windows pc.

I use the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) library which allows you to download software from the command line (so automatable).

I will update the list according to the software I need.

Feel free to create an issue if you encounter errors during execution.

## Launching the script

The script being in PowerShell, you must launch the script as an administrator:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
